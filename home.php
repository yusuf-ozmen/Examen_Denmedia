                    We serve dishes that you will not find on the menu at other Greek restaurants.
					We have also put the classics, such as moussaka and souvlaki, in our own jacket.
					The emphasis is on taste experience and quality.
					Our Greek chefs have a great culinary knowledge and continue to expand it.
					The menu is therefore regularly updated. 'Cause we don't settle for good
					but always want better. In short,
					with us not too large portions and a ceiling full of vines.
					But original dishes of high quality, served in a modern establishment.
